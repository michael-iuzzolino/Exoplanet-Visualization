Mouseover the genes pops out the gene and highlights the related link and nodes in the network visualization. Conversely, mouseover a link in the neural network visualization will highlight the respective network elements as well as highlight and popout the respective gene in the genome. Clicking on the gene or the link will fully open the gene in the genome, displaying information about the weight, its connecting nodes, innovation number, etc. Mouseover of a node will highlight all nodes that are connected to it via both enabled and disabled links. Lastly, the disabled links can be hidden by clicking the button in the top right of the visualization. Hiding the nodes enables the network visualization of the final state of the network in the evolutionary sequence.
